# GameOn

Front-end codebase for my GameOn app. This is a re-build of my [Quasar version](https://github.com/gargrave/gameon-client-quasar) of the same app, mostly because I wanted to focus on React over Vue. It uses the same Django REST Framework API as the previous project.

This is very much a work-in-progress, so it still has quite a number of features that need to be added before it is useful.

You can find the current WIP back-end codebase [here](https://github.com/gargrave/gameon-server).

(More info to come in the future...)
