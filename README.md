# GameOn (React)

Partial front end code base for my GameOn app (the Django REST Framework server code base can be found [here](https://github.com/gargrave/gameon-server)). Note that I have retired this version of the front end code and replaced it with the Vue/Quasar version [here](https://github.com/gargrave/gameon-client-quasar). Unfortunately, the boilerplate I chose for this React project proved to be a little cumbersome to maintain, so I decided to move on before it was deployed.

If you look around, you will see a lot of the usual suspects: React, Redux, React Router, Thunk, Jest, Material UI, Sass, etc. All good stuff, but this is one of those projects that just didn't work out.
